			<h1>What is Coaching?</h1>
			<hr>

		  <div>
			<p>Coaching is “Helping another person make progress on their intentional change.&quot; <sup>1</sup></p>
				<p>Executive Coaching focuses on leaders in the C-suite (CEO’s, COO’s, CFO’s, etc.) or their potential successors.
					These leaders manage a great deal of responsibility in a complex, stressful, ever changing environment.</p>
				<p>Woolford & Associates utilizes coaching philosophy and processes of Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve
					University, along with 20 years of coaching experience.</p>
				<p><i style="font-style: normal">We believe that adults learn and change their behavior most when they want or need to change. Learning needs to be self-directed, with
						readiness and motivation to develop personally and professionally coming from the individual, not from external sources.
						Using the Theory of Intentional Change, developed by Weatherhead faculty member Richard Boyatzis, Ph.D., Woolford & Associates will
						help you explore aspirations for work and life; analyze current competencies, behaviors, and learning style; and determine steps to implement
						the changes you seek.</i></p>
				<p><i style="font-style: normal">The Intentional Change Theory (ITC) <sup>2</sup> provides a path for learning, development, and sustainable change through five discoveries:</i></p>
				<p>
		    
			<ol>
						<li>The Ideal Self: includes a discovery of your deepest aspirations for your work and life through crafting of a personal vision statement</li>
						<li><i style="font-style: normal">The Real Self: deepening your self-awareness and ability to accurately assess your capabilities and competencies through a discovery of your strengths and gaps</i></li>
						<li><i style="font-style: normal">My Learning Agenda: translates the first 2 phases into an action plan</i></li>
						<li><i style="font-style: normal">Experimenting as a Leader: encompasses experimentation and practice with desired behavior</i></li>
						<li><i style="font-style: normal">Trusting Relationships: leveraging of trusting and supportive relationships to support your change process</i></li>
